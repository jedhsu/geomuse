## music

`music` consists of data models from music theory, analyzed from a geometric perspective.

The key principle is that the

* partition of the audio spectrum into keys and the
* partition of time into pulsed beats 

are treated as isomorphic.

On each dimension, models take after the number line if appropriate. For example, frequency is a real number, while the notes of the diatonic scale are integers.
