Music is a physical representation of set-theoretic mathematics.

If tangible objects are physical entities in space processed by humans to have shape (or physical form), music is a collection of physical entities in time processed by humans to have shape.

We know that the physics of our universe are increasingly likely to be non-set-theoretic. This is evident from the results of special relativity and conjectures in intuitionistic mathematics.

Consider a spectral slice, i.e. a sample. This is technically not a well-defined physical form.
